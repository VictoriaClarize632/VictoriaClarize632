    <h2 id="me">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Victoria Clarize Lozada, a third-year BSIS student at WVSU and an aspiring entrepreneur. I’m passionate about exploring new business opportunities and excited to share my journey with others. My family has a deep-rooted passion for cooking, and we specialize in preparing homemade meals delivered through food riders. At 17, I first conceived the idea of starting a business and presented a proposal to my mother and older siblings. This led to the opening of our first physical restaurant. Sadly, a few months ago, we had to give up the business due to the lack of manpower and failure to manage the business properly. After some time, a new opportunity was given to us to reopen again this year. Thus, I will be sharing below the proposed concept in my mind.</p>
