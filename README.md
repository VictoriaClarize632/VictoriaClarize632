    <h2 id="me">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Victoria Clarize Lozada, a third-year BSIS student at WVSU and an aspiring entrepreneur. I’m passionate about exploring new business opportunities and excited to share my journey with others. My family has a deep-rooted passion for cooking, and we specialize in preparing homemade meals delivered through food riders. At 17, I first conceived the idea of starting a business and presented a proposal to my mother and older siblings. This led to the opening of our first physical restaurant.</p>
